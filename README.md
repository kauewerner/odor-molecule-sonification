# Sonification of Odor molecules

A SuperCollider program for creating and manipulating sound timbres and sequences based on data from IR spectrum measurements of molecules perceived by the human olfatory system. The synthesis method used is a mixture of additive and FM syntheses. The IR spectrum is used both for the timbre of each molecule as well as for its note scale. This code has been used in live perfomances and sound production of an ongoing project by [Sintodrama](http://sintodrama.bandcamp.com).
